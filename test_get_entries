        attacks, natural disasters, civil unrest, and large-scale accidents, all can
        leave large numbers of British nationals in need of urgent help. \n\nIf British
        nationals are involved in a large-scale crisis overseas, an FCO RDT (Rapid
        Deployment Team) may be deployed to the affected area. Each week 30 volunteers
        are on standby globally (London, Middle East, Asia Pacific and Americas),
        to deploy within 2 hours to assist the local Diplomatic Post in a consular
        emergency.  RDTs were first introduced by the FCO after the Bali bombings
        that took place in 2002, which killed 202 people including 27 British nationals.\n\nThe
        role of an RDT includes providing help to British nationals affected by the
        incident, and to the families of victims; establishing links with the local
        authorities and emergency services; and ensuring co-operation with other British
        agencies who are responding.\n\nRDT&#039;s consist of FCO personnel and supplier
        provided Pyscho-Social Support Teams (PST)\n\nThe PST deploy with, and are
        considered part of, the RDTs. When PST deploy, they do so in pairs e.g. 2
        PST members per RDT. Over the past 5 years, the PST has deployed 91 staff
        to 11 separate overseas incidents.\n\nCrisis Management Department (CMD) delivers
        RDT training in London three times per year.  The PST provider is required
        to present on the RDT training course.  They will run a session covering the
        theory of PST and how they will work with an RDT on deployment.\n\nThe Pyscho-Social
        Support Teams (PST) are highly trained individuals who deploy overseas with
        Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Rapid Deployment Teams (RDT) during
        crises to locations where there has been significant trauma and/or loss of
        life to British nationals. Past deployments have included Tunisia, Thailand,
        and Algeria.\n\nPST members are able to assess the requirement for and provide
        emotional support to British nationals overseas in any given situation e.g.
        the tsunami in Thailand in 2004, the Sousse terrorism incident in 2015. They
        also provide support to RDT members as necessary.\n\nIn addition to overseas
        deployments, the PST supplier deliver training three times per year, together
        with the FCO, to new members of the RDT.'>A key FCO priority is to protect

        attacks, natural disasters, civil unrest, and large-scale accidents, all can
        leave large numbers of British nationals in need of urgent help. \n\nIf British
        nationals are involved in a large-scale crisis overseas, an FCO RDT (Rapid
        Deployment Team) may be deployed to the affected area. Each week 30 volunteers
        are on standby globally (London, Middle East, Asia Pacific and Americas),
        to deploy within 2 hours to assist the local Diplomatic Post in a consular
        emergency.  RDTs were first introduced by the FCO after the Bali bombings
        that took place in 2002, which killed 202 people including 27 British nationals.\n\nThe
        role of an RDT includes providing help to British nationals affected by the
        incident, and to the families of victims; establishing links with the local
        authorities and emergency services; and ensuring co-operation with other British
        agencies who are responding.\n\nRDT&#039;s consist of FCO personnel and supplier
        provided Pyscho-Social Support Teams (PST)\n\nThe PST deploy with, and are
        considered part of, the RDTs. When PST deploy, they do so in pairs e.g. 2
        PST members per RDT. Over the past 5 years, the PST has deployed 91 staff
        to 11 separate overseas incidents.\n\nCrisis Management Department (CMD) delivers
        RDT training in London three times per year.  The PST provider is required
        to present on the RDT training course.  They will run a session covering the
        theory of PST and how they will work with an RDT on deployment.\n\nThe Pyscho-Social
        Support Teams (PST) are highly trained individuals who deploy overseas with
        Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Rapid Deployment Teams (RDT) during
        crises to locations where there has been significant trauma and/or loss of
        life to British nationals. Past deployments have included Tunisia, Thailand,
        and Algeria.\n\nPST members are able to assess the requirement for and provide
        emotional support to British nationals overseas in any given situation e.g.
        the tsunami in Thailand in 2004, the Sousse terrorism incident in 2015. They
        also provide support to RDT members as necessary.\n\nIn addition to overseas
        deployments, the PST supplier deliver training three times per year, together
        with the FCO, to new members of the RDT.'>A key FCO priority is to protect

        of sponsorship monies for cycling events, including the Isle of Wight stage
        of the Tour of Britain to be held in September 2021\",\"The Isle of Wight
        Council (\"\"the Authority\"\") invites Quotes from suitably qualified suppliers
        (\"\"Potential Suppliers\"\") for the provision of sourcing sponsorship monies
        for cycling events, including the Isle of Wight stage of the Tour of Britain
        to be held in September 2021.\r\n\r\nThe Authority has secured the rights
        to the final stage of the 2021 Tour of Britain which will take place in September
        2021 (date to be confirmed).\r\n\r\nThe cost for the rights is \xA3250,000
        and the Authority will have additional costs of \xA390,000 to host the event,
        a total of \xA3340,000. It hopes to recover this sum through sponsorship revenue.\r\n\r\nThe
        Authority is therefore seeking an experienced fundraiser to secure sponsorship
        on a commission only basis. The council does not intend to pay any retainer
        or fixed fee.\r\n\r\nThe term of the contract shall be 29 June 2020 until
        30 September 2023. During this term the Authority can call off from the appointed
        Supplier sourcing of sponsorship services for events. Under this procurement
        process the Authority is looking to specifically instruct the sourcing of
        sponsorship monies for the final stage of the Tour of Britain in 2021 which
        will be held on the Isle of Wight. Whilst the agreement will be available
        until 30 September 2023 for further commissions, the Authority makes no guarantee
        that any future work will be instructed under this contract. The term for
        the final stage of the Tour of Britain commission shall be 11 May 2020 until
        30 September 2021.  \r\n\",,,\"South East\",\"79342100 \",\"Hayley Holden\",hayley.holden@iow.gov.uk,\"County

        SUPPORT FOR CRISIS MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT\",\"A key FCO priority is to protect
        our people including at times of crisis through effective and swift crisis
        response. Crises can include terrorist attacks, natural disasters, civil unrest,
        and large-scale accidents, all can leave large numbers of British nationals
        in need of urgent help. \r\n\r\nIf British nationals are involved in a large-scale
        crisis overseas, an FCO RDT (Rapid Deployment Team) may be deployed to the
        affected area. Each week 30 volunteers are on standby globally (London, Middle
        East, Asia Pacific and Americas), to deploy within 2 hours to assist the local
        Diplomatic Post in a consular emergency.  RDTs were first introduced by the
        FCO after the Bali bombings that took place in 2002, which killed 202 people
        including 27 British nationals.\r\n\r\nThe role of an RDT includes providing
        help to British nationals affected by the incident, and to the families of
        victims; establishing links with the local authorities and emergency services;
        and ensuring co-operation with other British agencies who are responding.\r\n\r\nRDT's
        consist of FCO personnel and supplier provided Pyscho-Social Support Teams
        (PST)\r\n\r\nThe PST deploy with, and are considered part of, the RDTs. When
        PST deploy, they do so in pairs e.g. 2 PST members per RDT. Over the past
        5 years, the PST has deployed 91 staff to 11 separate overseas incidents.\r\n\r\nCrisis
        Management Department (CMD) delivers RDT training in London three times per
        year.  The PST provider is required to present on the RDT training course.
        \ They will run a session covering the theory of PST and how they will work
        with an RDT on deployment.\r\n\r\nThe Pyscho-Social Support Teams (PST) are
        highly trained individuals who deploy overseas with Foreign and Commonwealth
        Office (FCO) Rapid Deployment Teams (RDT) during crises to locations where
        there has been significant trauma and/or loss of life to British nationals.
        Past deployments have included Tunisia, Thailand, and Algeria.\r\n\r\nPST
        members are able to assess the requirement for and provide emotional support
        to British nationals overseas in any given situation e.g. the tsunami in Thailand
        in 2004, the Sousse terrorism incident in 2015. They also provide support
        to RDT members as necessary.\r\n\r\nIn addition to overseas deployments, the

        - BROMMHILL LIBRARY WALL COLLAPSE\",\"The project comprises works to reconstruct
        a stone wall within the garden of Broomhill Library that has suffered a partial
        collapse.  \r\n \r\nThe library garden was designed by Percy Cane and is of
        local historical importance. The Friends of Broomhill Library have secured
        funding to redevelop the library garden, however, until the garden is clear
        of masonry and the wall rebuilt no work can take place.  \r\n \r\nThe nursing
        home that adjoins the library garden is keen to reinstate the boundary wall
        as the Heras fencing securing the collapsed wall is reducing the amount of
        car parking space for the nursing home. \r\n \r\nInvestigations by a Structural
        engineer and a CCTV drainage survey of both the library and adjacent nursing
        home site have identified probable causes of the collapse as:  \r\n  \r\n-
        A very large established tree behind the wall on the neighbouring properties
        land has been pushing on the wall as well as its root system mechanically
        interacting with the wall and its foundations \r\n \r\n- Some recent repointing
        work has increased the weight marginally on the garden face of the wall. This
        has limited water from draining through the wall on the retained side increasing
        the water pressure in the retained material. \r\n \r\n- The CCTV drainage
        survey identified a broken land drain on the nursing home grounds.  Water
        from this drain has been leaking under the wall. \r\n \r\nWorks to remove
        the tree and repair the drain have been undertaken prior to these works being
        tendered.  \r\n \r\nThe works to reinstate the wall include the demolition
        of some of the existing wall that is bowing, cleaning and preserving the existing
        stone for re-use where possible, excavation and casting a new increased footing,
        and rebuilding of the wall to include a wider construction in part to form
        a retaining structure and the introduction of weep holes.  \r\n \r\nIt will
        also be necessary to remove, protect and reinstate some original stone features
        during the course of the works.  \r\n \r\nDue to the proximity of the site
        to neighbouring property there will be a requirement to undertake some facilitating
        works on the land of the adjacent residential home including works to reinstate
        any disruption caused to neighbouring property during the course of the works.\",,,\"Yorkshire

        and two Community Rehabilitation Companies, we support 25,000 people a year
        with employment, resettlement and probation services.\r\n\r\nOur HMPPS CFO3
        programmes are delivered by our subsidiary company, APM UK, (acquired in 2019)
        who have delivered CFO programmes to improve the employment prospects of offenders
        since the Phase 1 programme began in 2009 across East Midlands, Yorkshire
        & Humber, North East and West Midlands. APM UK recruits offenders and delivers
        programme and post-programme support in local communities and prison settings
        via its own direct delivery and its managed partner network.\r\n\r\nIngeus
        are intending to tender for the HMPPS CFO Activity Hubs opportunity, expected
        in April 2020.  This contract will be delivered in England and is due to commence
        in January 2021 for a duration of 32 months.\r\n\r\nProgramme Aims\r\n\r\nThe
        Hub programme will have dual aims; to increase effective engagement with mainstream
        or core services and to encourage participation in activities to assist individuals
        to lead law abiding lives, to not re-offend and to move closer to the labour
        market.  \r\n\r\nActivity Hubs will be based in community locations and provide
        bespoke, tailored support in a safe and supportive environment for offenders
        to reintegrate into society through a range of meaningful activities. \r\n\r\nThese
        services will cover the following Activity-based categories:\r\n- Human Citizenship
        - activities which develop the sense of self-worth, enabling participants
        to develop positive plans for the future. \r\n- Community and Social Factors
        - activities which build personal resilience, strengthen support networks
        and upskill participants through developing tools, skills and links to support
        to overcome barriers. \r\n- Interventions and Services - activities that clearly
        link to the reducing recidivism agenda. Most of these activities need to be
        accredited.\r\n\r\nService Delivery\r\n\r\nThe Provision is voluntary for
        participants. Engagement will be focused on participants at risk of re-offending
        following release and those serving community sentences. Emphasis will be
        on effective targeting of the most appropriate participants, who are unlikely
        to benefit from other services as a result of facing complex barriers. \r\n
        \r\nWe are inviting Expressions of Interests from organisations of all sizes,
        particularly local organisations or community representatives, to support
        the engagement of and increase participant integration by delivering bespoke
        activity services in the Activity Hubs.  Ideally, organisations have experience
        of supporting offenders/ex-offenders who have multiple, complex barriers to
        deliver tailored and engaging programme interventions to achieve a positive
        outcome. We are also interested in hearing from organisations who can provide

        delivered by the end of August 2023.\r\nThe Activity Hub programme is voluntary,

        Participants should also be a UK resident, and aged 18+, with a focus on specific
        priority groups, including BAME, women, those with disabilities/health conditions,
        those aged 50+ and ex-service personnel. \r\nThe Hub programme will have dual
        aims: to increase participant's effective engagement with mainstream or core

        can, and importantly want to, engage in a range of activity. Hubs will be
        placed in communities and involve local organisations to increase participant
        engagement and integration, and offer tailored support for offenders - particularly
        those who are considered disadvantaged, face multiple barriers to employment
        and those that are not engaged or supported by existing programmes. The purpose
        of the Hub will be to assist Participants not to re-offend, alongside the
        key aim of ESF to move individuals closer to the labour market. \r\nReed in

        Insight is a collaborative research and innovation think tank. We're working
        to understand the challenges people face in saving for their later lives,
        and to develop and test solutions to those challenges. Although we sit within
        Nest and draw learnings from the rich set of data Nest is building, we also
        work across the industry with other providers, from pensions, banking, fintech
        and beyond. We share all our work widely to influence industry and policy
        makers in the UK and internationally. We depend on sponsorships, grants and
        in-kind support from organisations that share our values.\r\n\r\nWe work on
        three main areas to help low to moderate earners achieve the outcomes they
        hope for at retirement:\r\n1.\tSmarter saving behaviours: Positively influencing
        the behaviour of current retirement savers - focusing on those behaviours
        that will make the greatest difference to their retirement outcomes.\r\n2.\tSupporting
        at risk groups to save: Extending participation in retirement saving to at
        risk and excluded groups, including those outside of 'traditional' employment
        such as self-employed people, gig workers and carers and those who may face
        additional challenges, such as people living with mental health conditions.\r\n3.\tSaving
        in context: Looking at retirement saving in the context of the whole household
        balance sheet to understand how different financial behaviours interact with
        retirement saving, and how best to help people manage the trade-offs and tensions
        between different priorities.\r\n\r\nWe do this through an ambitious programme
        of research, trials, events and publications, delivered in partnership with
        academics, think tanks, government and the industry. \r\n\r\n1.2.The UK Sidecar
        Savings Trial\r\nNest Insight is currently conducting a research trial of
        a hybrid sidecar savings tool in the UK. Over a multi-year research project
        we are exploring whether creating a link between liquid and illiquid savings
        enhances the financial wellbeing of savers. \r\n\r\nThe research team is led
        by Professor David Laibson of Harvard University and includes other academics
        as well as researchers from Nest Insight and the Money and Pensions Service.
        The work is jointly funded by BlackRock, the JP Morgan Chase Foundation and
        the Money and Pensions Service. The appointed savings technology partner is
        Salary Finance.\r\n\r\nThe trial is exploring whether a hybrid savings tool
        can address two consumer finance issues:\r\n-\tAccording to research by MAPS,
        only 44 per cent of the UK's working population have \xA3500 or more in liquid
        savings on hand for emergencies, and 26 per cent have nothing. This means
        that many may have no choice but to turn to high cost sources of credit/borrowing
        if a they're faced with a high or unexpected cost.\",,\"E14 4PU\",London,\"73000000

        and will be required to complete the works to each property within 2 weeks.\r\n

        its operations to be compliant with the COVID-19 restrictions regarding social
        distancing, but is also very keen to be in a good position to resume its normal
        services and planned works once the restrictions have been lifted, Accordingly
        we are progressing activities that are compatible with the current market
        conditions, such as procurement.\r\n      The tender period for this project
        has an extended deadline on the assumption that the COVID-19 crisis will have
        abated enough by mid-May to allow for a site visit by potential suppliers
        on 21st May. This may be optimistic, but if the social distancing restrictions
        are not relaxed by then, then we will extend the timetable further to allow

        providers to apply to join. Providers must recognise the role they play in
        ensuring that people with learning disabilities experience the good health
        and wellbeing necessary to live a meaningful life. Providers should be aware
        that there are higher incidences of long term conditions, and other health
        problems, experienced by people with learning disabilities and prioritises
        preventative and palliative services and support to minimise potential impacts
        to service users. As such staff must have sufficient and appropriate training
        and skills to effectively engage people with learning disabilities in health
        promotion. The Council is trying to move towards a model that helps people
        to live as independently as possible at all levels of need, so the focus is

        Intelligence - Network Bus Solution\",\"Milton Keynes Council is preparing
        to retender all of its existing contracted bus services. The current contracts
        are due end in October 2020. A dynamic purchasing system is being put in place
        for the tender process, however we wanted to take this opportunity to see
        if there is a viable, network wide alternative to simply replacing traditional
        bus services.\r\nWe therefore invite interest from operators holding PSV,
        taxi or private hire licenses that could put forward a network wide solution
        to compliment a commercial bus network.\r\nKey considerations:\r\nTraditional
        buses, Demand Responsive shared vehicles  or a mix of both are acceptable
        in the solution\r\nAccessible vehicles must be available where needed.\r\nWhere
        demand responsive solutions are proposed, technology to summon vehicles must
        be widely accessible for all.\r\nThe Council has a commitment to be carbon
        neutral by 2030 and any proposal will need to show how this aim is being supported\r\nThe
        Council would likely seek to reduce the amount of subsidy year on year so
        any solution should be working towards being self sustaining in the long term.
        \r\nWhere operations utilising taxi and private licenses are proposed we would
        expect licenses to be obtained from Milton Keynes Council, in order to ensure
        vehicles and drivers comply with locally determined standards.\r\nAny solution
        must have the capability of operating Borough wide but not compete with the
        commercial bus network.\r\nPayment systems must be compatible with MK Council's
        ITSO smart ticket platform, powered by Swift.\r\nMaximum fares should be set
        by the Council\r\nThis is an open call for interest which is expected to lead
        to constructive dialogue in order for a full specification to be developed,

        for the provision of replacement foot passenger launch service. This service
        is for the provision of a replacement foot passenger launch to operate between
        Cowes and East Cowes when the Floating Bridge is not available. The Cowes
        to East Cowes crossing is undertaken by the Floating Bridge and it has a capacity
        of 20 cars and 140-foot passengers. The Floating Bridge operates 365 days
        per year; days and times of operation of the floating bridge are as follows:
        - \u2022 Monday to Saturday 05.00 to 00.30 \u2022 Sunday 06.30 to 00.30 The

        Bridge has its required annual inspection. This is undertaken by the Maritime
        and Coastguard Agency (MCA) and this is normally scheduled in late April or
        early May; whilst this is undertaken with the vessel in service it may be
        necessary to withdraw the vessel from service to undertake any identified
        works. The replacement foot passenger launch service is also required to operate
        at other times as and when the Floating Bridge is out of service as a result
        of planned maintenance works; technical issues and either weather or environmental
        conditions. The replacement foot passenger launch service is required to operate
        between the Floating Bridge Ferry pontoon adjacent to the Cowes Slipway at
        the end of Medina Road and the Grid Iron pontoon off Castle Street in East

        Database Software\",\"The Productivity through Innovation Project (PtI) is
        a programme which allows SME businesses to access funding, services and support
        services across the D2N2 region.  \r\nThe nature of the programme means it
        is not suitable for new start businesses, those with limited growth potential
        and those who do not have the absorptive capacity for research and innovation
        projects. This means that a high number of SME's that have come through past
        ERDF projects are unlikely to be suitable as we are targeting research active
        or intensive SMEs. Therefore, PtI is also looking to attract companies who
        have not engaged with the University before and also target sectors that may
        have been underrepresented and difficult to reach in the past.\r\nA key part
        of the project activity is the offering of MPhil placements for companies.
        This is a brand-new concept for the University and its engagement with industry.
        \ This offering will need a great deal of support in terms of marketing and
        awareness building for it to be a success.\r\nTo this end there is a need
        to acquire a Database that can identify high growth, R&D active companies
        in the D2N2 region. This information is particularly important in identifying
        companies who would have the interest and capacity to take on MPhil projects.\r\nThe
        ideal database would have the ability to look in great depth into companies
        background and history to provide a good detailed overview about potential
        leads. This would include grant awards, sectors they are active in and look

        offers free technical support and grant funding for energy efficiency and
        renewable energy projects to businesses, public-sector and community organisations
        in Dorset.  And aims to help Dorset based organisations to improve energy
        efficiency, increase the use of renewable energy, and aid the development
        of new low carbon products in Dorset.\r\nThe programme is led by Dorset Council
        (DC) and the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and funded by
        the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).\r\nThe programme launched in
        April 2018 and is now in its final year of delivery.  Dorset Council recently
        submitted a bid for a further \xA34.26m of ERDF funding, which, if successful

        successful in securing the additional funds in July 2020.\r\nAs part of the

        as a \"\"Summative Assessment\"\".  We wish to identify a suitably experienced

        for the summative assessment and its development.  The provider shall be required
        to work closely with the Council to undertake a programme evaluation and provide
        a final summative assessment report together with a summary in line with the

        Leadership Apprenticeship\",\"MoJ Apprenticeships team has identified a gap
        in the current apprenticeship offer. Senior leadership capability is a key
        priority for the department and there is currently no apprenticeship on offer
        to fill this learning gap. \r\n\r\nHigh attrition rates at Grades 6/7 and
        above, particularly in London, are impacting on business productivity and
        corporate memory and knowledge. Offering a Level 7 Masters in Leadership &
        Management will not only help retain our most talented individuals, it will
        also help to attract staff to the department where they can see a structured
        leadership career path, and a willingness to invest in personal learning.
        \r\n\r\nOffering Masters level apprenticeships will also enhance the MoJ Social
        Mobility strategy by allowing employees who did not attend university to gain
        higher level qualifications whilst in the workplace. This opens the door for
        staff who have joined at more junior levels to climb the career ladder, therefore

        of networking and development workshops that provide each cohort of participating
        fellows with the tools to think creatively and to develop and lead new and
        imaginative thinking that spans disciplinary boundaries. In addition to this,
        activities should be in place that support and enable the development of skills
        and leadership in; Communications & media, Public engagement with research,
        Collaboration & cross-sector working, and Impact. Furthermore, it is expected
        that the network will enable fellows to engage with and receive mentoring
        from influential research and innovation leaders and will support engagement
        with key challenges facing the research and innovation environment.\r\nThe
        proposed network should provide these opportunities for up to 250 fellows,
        including those funded through rounds one to three of the FLF, and ensure
        that each intake of fellows into the network is able to access opportunities
        over a two-year period.\r\nThe FLF Development Network should last for three
        years, and up to \xA33 million is available to support this.\r\n\",,,\"Any

        Thames Tideway Tunnel project (the Project) will control CSO discharges by
        intercepting and diverting combined sewage flows into a new storage and transfer
        tunnel. The main tunnel will run from Acton Storm Tanks in west London to
        Abbey Mills Pumping Station in the east, where it will connect to the Lee
        Tunnel, which will transfer the combined sewage to Beckton Sewage Treatment
        Works for treatment. The Project extends from Acton Storm Tanks in west London,
        to Abbey Mills Pumping Station in east London. The Project includes associated
        works at Beckton STW, Shad Thames Pumping Station and Bekesbourne Street.
        \r\n    \r\n    The geographic layout of the Project and local authorities
        through which it passes is shown in Figure 1.\r\n    The Project comprises:\r\n

        \   As part of the works for the Thames Tideway West project at Hammersmith
        Pumping Station (HAMPS), BMB are required to construct a Connection Culvert
        that will take the storm flows from the existing Thames Water Infrastructure
        into the new Tideway Tunnels and a Deaeration Gallery providing ventilation
        throughout the system. The pumping station is sited to the north of the River
        Thames, just west of the Hammersmith Bridge. These works are to run concurrently
        with other BMB areas of work including CSO Drop Shaft and Inlet Channel works.
        \ Full welfare facilities will be provided to all sub-contractors.\r\n    \r\n
        \   This is for the construction of the permanent RC structures detailed below
        and include:\r\n    \u2022\tConnection Culvert\r\n    \u2022\tFlow Measurement
        Chamber (sited on top of the south end of the Connection Culvert)\r\n    \u2022\tDeaeration
        Gallery \r\n    \r\n    All method statements and ITP's will be complied by
        BMB with input from the FRC Subcontractor on all areas of the construction
        process.\r\n    \r\n    All materials that will be used in the permanent works
        will be supplied by BMB along with the associated Materials Compliance Record
        (MCRs) again with full input from the FRC Subcontractor.  \r\n    \r\n    BMB
        will supply the concrete and reinforcement for all permanent works including
        blinding.  \r\n    \r\n    The successful bidder will provide all means of
        concrete placement and labour to carry out the works safely, efficiently and
        to a high-quality standard.\r\n    \r\n    All temporary materials required
        and used for the construction of these phases of work will be supplied by
        the FRC Subcontractor.\r\n    \r\n    All temporary works are to be designed,
        supplied, erected and maintained by the FRC Subcontractor along with the associated
        CAT 3 check for each temporary works design.\r\n    \r\n    The tower crane
        will provide all lifting requirements; however, it is not allocated to the
        culvert & deaeration 100%.  It services all other areas of site.  Forward
        planning of the tower crane duties is discussed through the Site and Coordination
        Meetings to reduce delays where possible.\r\n    \r\n    NOTE: no delay claims
        will be accepted for lack of tower crane time or due to the tower crane being
        winded off.  Other lifting options will be looked at to mitigate delays in
        a case by case basis.\r\n    \r\n     \r\n     Returned quotations will be
        evaluated by BMB JV's (BAM Nuttall, Morgan Sindall PLC & Balfour Beatty) Procurement
        team in conjunction with our design and engineering teams.\r\n    Quotations

        subsidiary of Transport for London) to design and manufacture 94 new generation
        of Tube trains to replace the existing 1970s fleet.\r\n      \r\n      \u2022Ninety

        and improve accessibility\r\n      \u2022Additional capacity and improved
        customer experience for millions of passengers\r\n      \u2022The contract
        will facilitate a multi-million pound investment in a factory in Goole, East
        Yorkshire, creating thousands of UK jobs\r\n      \r\n      The current trains
        are old, increasingly unreliable and expensive to maintain. From 2023, new
        spacious 'Inspiro London' trains will be delivered for testing on the Piccadilly
        line, with current estimates indicating the first of these trains will be
        serving customers in 2024. These will improve reliability and enable increased
        frequencies during peak times by the end of 2026 (up from 24 to 27 trains-per-hour).
        This service - a train every 135 seconds at the busiest times - will help
        to address crowding on the line as London's population continues to rise.\r\n
        \     \r\n      The state-of-the-art Tube trains will significantly improve
        the experience of millions of customers, with wider doors and longer, walk-through,
        fully air-conditioned carriages. In addition, in-train information systems
        will help all customers plan their onward journey more easily.\r\n      \r\n
        \     The initial order is for 94 trains and an associated Fleet Services
        Agreement covering the supply of spares and whole life technical support (a
        value of approximately \xA31.5bn). This has been awarded with the expectation
        that Siemens Mobility will build trains for all four Deep Tube lines - the
        Piccadilly, Bakerloo, Central and Waterloo & City.\r\n      \r\n      About

        of GDC Fitness to Practise data\",\"The GDC invites tenders for a research
        project to improve the quality of data that we gather through the Fitness
        to Practise process and our ability to learn from the data. The aim of the
        research is to enable GDC to unlock the potential learning from data generated
        within our fitness to practice processes to:\r\n      \r\n      -    inform
        and underpin our ongoing ambitions to promote the principles of right touch
        regulation in our Fitness to Practise processes, including proportionality,
        consistency and transparency.\r\n      \r\n      -   inform our upstream strategy,
        which focuses on the prevention of harm rather than enforcement activity,
        including identifying insights to inform learning and action on the part of
        professionals to reduce levels of FtP concern raised.\r\n      \r\n      -
        \  provide an important foundation for future research, monitoring and evaluation
        plans and\r\n      \r\n      - provide evidence and insight that will inform
        GDC's continuing efforts to improve our approach to case analysis\r\n      \r\n
        \     \r\n      Underpinning the research aim are four primary objectives:
        \r\n      \r\n      -Understanding risk: to review historic Fitness to Practise
        case data (qualitative and quantitative)  to enable us to better understand
        and profile where FtP-related risk lies in the dentistry profession, including
        understanding the complexity of risk. \r\n      \r\n      -Defining considerations/categorisation:
        to review historical and current Fitness to Practise case data to make recommendations
        to better define considerations labelling/categorisation (these are the key
        factors/themes associated with each case) and to enable us to develop and
        revise our coding frame/s in order to be able to undertake in-depth and inferential
        analysis of qualitative case data.\r\n      \r\n      -Understanding decision-making:
        to review historic Fitness to Practise case files to enable us to better understand
        our approach to decision-making in Fitness to Practise cases in relation to
        how or whether cases progress. We currently have a robust auditing processes
        in place; the aim of this research is to draw further depth and breadth of
        learning about our handling of cases using a range of methods and data sources
        to inform our wider strategic objectives\r\n      -Sustainability: during
        and as a result of the review, to develop approaches, processes and use methods
        that can be trialled and tested at GDC to contribute to both Fitness to Practise
        casework coding and decisions and to generating data that could be adopted
        by GDC and used in all aspects of inquiry-based learning, reflective practice,
        transparent reporting and for a range of research purposes.\r\n      \r\n

        of patients.\r\n\r\nThe Local Plan for the Waveney District area of Suffolk
        for the period 2014 - 2036 has recently been published following a period
        of consultation and identifies significant house building plans (9235 new
        homes) in the Waveney area; 56 % (5206 homes) of this growth is planned to
        happen in Lowestoft.\r\n\r\nThe latest CQC inspection was carried out in September
        2019 and the practice is rated good overall, although requiring improvement

        Business Portal via the following link https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=cb4bd6b3-906a-ea11-80ff-005056b64545&p=8691483f-2f3d-e711-80e1-005056b64545\r\nThe
        requirement is for the construction and installation of Lariner Fish Pass
        on the River Great Stour at Olantigh Estate\r\n\r\nThe River Stour is the
        second longest river in Kent and is the major watercourse in the east of the
        county. The Great Stour's source is 75m above sea level near the village of
        Lenham, north-west of Ashford. The Great Stour then flows through Wye and
        the chalk North Downs to the cathedral city of Canterbury and then flows East
        and out to sea at Pegwell Bay.\r\n\r\nThe works are in the River Great Stour
        from Wye to the A2, GB107040019742 (Water body id).  \r\nOn leaving Wye the
        Stour flows in a north easterly direction, breaching the North Downs through
        the 'Wye Gap', and for most of this distance there are few tributaries, although
        the river interacts significantly with the groundwater and takes on many of
        the characteristics of a chalk stream.\r\n\r\nThe river is primarily rural
        in character for this section, passing through the grounds of some grand country
        houses. At Olantigh the river bifurcates and passes through 107 hectares of
        park and pleasure grounds of a mid-19th century private residence.\r\n\r\nAt
        Olantigh there are three structures which impact on fish passage, on these
        two channels.\r\n\r\nThe Waterbody Improvement Plan, 2017, undertaken by the
        Environment Agency states this section of the Stour as moderate and the reason
        for not achieving good ecological status as being due to water quality (particularly
        phosphates), low flow and fish passage.\r\n\r\nFish were in poor status as
        recently as 2010 but have recovered; further improvements are required if
        we are to achieve an improvement in overall status. Fish passage has been
        improved downstream through Canterbury.\r\n\r\nThe works are everything necessary
        for the construction and installation of a new Lariner Fish Pass and Eel Pass
        on the River Great Stour at Olantigh Estate. This includes the provision of
        temporary works to allow its construction in the river, reinforced and mass
        concrete, aluminium baffles, safety railings, top soiling and seeding and
        scour protection.\r\n\",,,\"South East\",\"45247220 \",\"Todd Davis\",Todd.Davis@kent.gov.uk,\"Sessions

        30 million passengers and a turnover of \xA350 million by 2030.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
        West Midlands Metro has a fleet of 21 Urbos 3 low floor trams.  Each tram
        has two (2) motorised and one (1) trailer bogie which are due for a major
        overhaul.\r\n\r\nThe P3 exam is required when a tram has covered 560,000 km,
        however, there is a +10% tolerance.  With the tolerance included, the maximum
        number of kilometres increases to 616,000 km.  Therefore, it is imperative
        that the overhauls are completed to prevent a tram being taken out of service.\r\n\r\nTender

        University Academies Trust is a Multi Academy Trust which currently consists
        of nineteen academies, of which there is one secondary academy and eighteen
        primary academies across Staffordshire; the Trust head offices are based in
        Stone, Staffordshire. \r\n\r\nSUAT promotes high aspirations and excellence
        for all. Our aim is to develop a strong partnership between the academies,
        pupils, and the wider community in order to secure an outstanding learning
        experience for everyone.  We have high expectations and strive to create independent
        learners fit for the demands of the 21st Century.\r\n\r\nQuality technology

        network agree and make plans and decisions for children and young people who
        \r\n\u2022\thave been identified as being at risk\r\n\u2022\tand are in need
        of a plan that will safeguard and promote their welfare\r\n\u2022\tand which
        will address the problems identified by professionals who know the child.\r\n\r\nFamily
        Group Conferences are arranged and co-ordinated by a Service Provider following
        an appropriate referral. They can be held for a variety of reasons related
        to the welfare of the child or young person. An FGC can involve all family
        members, friends and other adults who the family feel can contribute to making
        plans for the children. The decision makers at family group conferences are
        the family members and not the professionals. Professionals though, can also
        be included in the process as appropriate and with the agreement of the family.\r\n\r\nDorset
        Council has commissioned the use of Family Group Conferences since late 2015
        initially as a short-term pilot scheme and then through a longer formal contract.

        Health Supported Living Service - South\",\"The London Borough of Camden ('the
        Council') is seeking to award a contract for the provision of supported living
        services in the south of Camden.  This service forms part of the mental health
        supported accommodation pathway.  The pathway supports adults with severe
        mental illness (SMI) who are unable to live independently. The pathway accommodates
        residents who have lost their tenancies or are unable to live in their own
        home without support due to the lack of daily living skills. The supported
        living pathway often bridges the gap between a long stay in hospital and independent
        living. The mental health supported accommodation pathway fosters Camden's
        ambitions to make Camden a place \"\"...where everyone can lead happy, healthy
        and fulfilling lives\"\", and where \"\"no one should experience discrimination
        or be made to feel ashamed or isolated because of a mental health problem\"\".
        \ This service was previously tendered as two of four Lots in August 2019.

        the diffractometer in reflection geometry with the 1D or equivalent detector,

        potential amorphous fractions, (2) simple texture, (3) lattice strains and

        us to combine in a single experimental batch, depending on the sample characteristics,
        (1) standard 1D powder diffraction with (2) grazing incidence (GIXRD) to increase
        the sensitivity to the surface layer (3) simple texture measurement, by rotation

        Hub, Old Cattle Market, Camelford\",\"Camelford Town Council (CTC) is a forward-thinking,
        proactive town council, keen to regenerate Camelford by creating high quality
        facilities and enhancing existing facilities for all its residents to improve
        social and cultural cohesion. Its aim is to improve the places and spaces
        in Camelford, enabling people to come together and build strong relationships.
        \ CTC want to enable people to fulfil their potential by offering employment
        and/or volunteering opportunities, take part in community events (thus creating
        a sense of belonging) and involve as many people in our projects so that they
        feel a sense of ownership. \r\n\r\nCTC is looking to regenerate the Old Cattle
        Market site in the Summer of 2020  from a derelict historical site, into a
        multi-use, inclusive recreational facility.  This facility will meet the needs
        of our local community, the villages and towns in the surrounding area and
        bring in visitors and tourists to help regenerate Camelford, a once thriving
        market town.  The project includes a multi-use court (basketball, netball,
        dodgeball, tennis and five-a-side football), parkour area, outside gym equipment,
        community gardens, caf\xE9/youth hub, waterless toilet, and creation of an
        additional skate-able surface with lower boxes and rails to cater for younger
        children.\r\nExtensive community engagement has formed this vision.  The facilities
        and activities it proposes to offer are those that have been identified by
        our community. A wish to make life that little bit better, more enjoyable
        and more conducive to a sociable life where people will spend time together
        in a place they enjoy, with activities that will provide people with the confidence
        and skills to achieve their ambitions.  Anti-social behaviour, low self-esteem,
        low aspiration are current issues in Camelford. This project seeks to show
        our community, especially our children/young people, that they are worth investing
        in, and provide a network of people who can guide, teach and inspire them.
        \ CTC believes that the facilities and activities proposed are the most effective
        response to the issues that Camelford faces.  This regeneration will complement
        existing provision within our Town. It is realistic, sustainable and has full
        support of the community, the Town Council, local schools and businesses,
        local organisations and Cornwall Council.\r\n\r\nCTC is purchasing a 20ft
        x 6ft container to house the caf\xE9.  Consultation revealed that people would
        like a creperie.  This has the additional benefit of providing a food that
        is not currently served in Camelford, and therefore does not \"\"step on any
        toes\"\".  This is important to CTC.  Camelford currently has 3 caf\xE9/tea
        rooms, and so it is looking to provide something different.  Street food/Thai/Indian
        served in the evenings would be desirable.\",,,\"South West\",\"15000000 \",\"Amanda

        be commencing a tender for the delivery of a high-quality service to offer
        Debt Advisers working within the free to client sector quick and consistent
        responses to unusual or complex debt queries. The service will be delivered
        remotely by both phone and email.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the proposed service
        is intended to be within England only.\r\n\r\nThe service shall enable debt
        advisers to provide accurate debt advice to over-indebted clients, empowering
        advisers to achieve good client outcomes, and increasing adviser confidence
        by providing access to the most relevant technical and tailored advice.\r\n\r\nThe
        service should look to increase awareness of more complex legal information,
        lack of knowledge of certain procedures or pure complexity in application
        of the law.\r\n\r\nIt should be accessible to independent debt advice agencies,
        local Citizens Advice, local authorities, housing associations, IMA members
        and other voluntary sector agencies. \r\n\r\nWhilst the preferred delivery
        approach is via a single organisation, MaPS may also consider splitting the
        requirement into lots if there is evidence that this will allow greater value
        for money and equity of access across the debt advice sector. (To be defined
        in the tender)\r\n\r\nThe indicative annual budget is \xA3700k over a 3yr
        + 2yr duration. This is subject to change and will be confirmed at tender
        stage. \r\n\r\nMaPS intends to hold a Market Engagement event (likely to hold
        in London) for the Specialist Debt Advice Support Service on the 31st March
        2020. This will provide an opportunity for prospective suppliers to find out
        more about the aims of the proposed tender and contract(s), the process involved
        as well as network opportunities with others. MaPS will use the opportunity
        to gather intelligence from suppliers which may influence the final tender.\r\n\r\nEligible
        organisations wishing to participate in the future tender process should be
        aware of the eligibility criteria as outlined below:\r\n\r\nAny organisation
        that wishes to deliver debt advice is required to obtain FCA authorisation
        unless they qualify for an exemption.\r\n\r\nProspective suppliers are advised
        that the FCA authorisation process can take up to 12 months.\r\n\r\nPlease
        note that this authorisation process is outside the scope of MAPS. Prospective
        suppliers are advised to visit the FCA website to find out more about application
        for authorisation and exemptions. https://www.fca.org.uk/\r\n\r\nProspective

        \     o A comparative assessment of strategic development options, and\r\n
        \     o A transport impact assessment and transport modelling to support the
        comparative assessment\r\n      \r\n      These are seen as two separate commissions

        intends to award two separate contracts as a result of this tender.\r\n      \r\n

        \     \r\n      In order to allow Harper and Keele Vet School students to
        attend joint lectures and other joint teaching, a competent and reliable Service
        Provider is required to provide transport for students between the two University
        campuses.  Tenders are therefore invited from interested parties for the Provision
        of Transport for Harper and Keele Vet School in accordance with the Tender
        Specification in Section 2 of the ITT.\r\n      \r\n      The Contract covers
        the transport requirements for the 1st year students only (\"\"Year 1 Students\"\")
        for a three year period ie for the Year 1 Students in academic years 2020/21,
        2021/22 and 2022/23 with an option to extend the transport provision for the
        Year 1 Students for two further years (ie for academic years 2023/24 and 2024/25).
        \ Full details of the transport requirements are given in the Tender Specification
        in Section 2 of the ITT.\r\n      \r\n      The Transport Service will commence
        on 28/09/2020. The University will finalise the contract with the Service
        Provider by 01/06/2020.\r\n      \r\n      Tenderers should note that two
        options are being considered in regards to the number of people per journey
        requiring transport. These are:\r\n      Option A - the transport of 55 students
        per journey.\r\n      Option B - the transport of 60 students / staff per
        journey (this over capacity will allow for staff / extra student travel between
        each University campus).\r\n      \r\n      These options will apply to the
        transport requirements for the Year 1 Students within each academic year.
        Tenderers are required to provide pricing for both options in the Tender Pricing
        Schedule in Section 4 of the ITT - Tender Forms for Completion and Return.
        \ Your tender will be disregarded if you fail to provide pricing for both
        options.\r\n      \r\n      The University Libraries at Harper and Keele wish
        to utilise the transport provision for the Year 1 Students within each academic
        year for a book delivery and collection service between the two Universities
        to assist Vet School students in their studies.  This is only a nominal requirement
        and shall be accommodated by the Service Provider using the same transport
        as used for students / staff.  The book delivery and collection service must
        be provided irrespective of which Option is selected in regards to the number
        of people per journey requiring transport. Full details of the book delivery
        and collection service requirements are given in the Tender Specification
        in Section 2 of the ITT.\r\n      \r\n      Given the need for one Service
        Provider to co-ordinate the delivery of all of the services required, the

        SW Exeter HIF - A379 Eastern Junction\",\"The overall objective of this scheme
        is to improve the accessibility of the A379 for all type of users: pedestrians,
        cyclists and motorists, between the Devon Hotel roundabout and the Sannerville
        Way roundabout, Exeter, prior to major development planned to the south west
        of Exeter. (UK Ordnance Survey grid reference SX 93217 89154). At present,
        this section of the A379 is a 4-lane single carriageway with limited facilities
        for pedestrians/cyclists. There are no crossing facilities near the Sannerville
        Way roundabout and a narrow shared use path on the south side of this road.
        The proposal seeks to introduce a new toucan crossing on the approach to the
        Sannerville Way roundabout to connect the south side of the A379 with the
        existing shared use path on Bridge Road and Matford Marsh. The existing shared
        use path on the A379 will also be widened where possible. Furthermore, a new
        signalised junction will be created with a new side road to the south of the
        A379 which will provide access to the proposed development area. The elements
        of work included in this phase of the scheme are, but not limited to: \u2022
        Site Clearance \u2022 Earthworks \u2022 Drainage Works \u2022 Introduction
        of a staggered toucan crossing. \u2022 Modification and widening, where possible,

        - Smart Meter EV Charging SBRI\",\"*****UPDATED 08/04 - SEE REVISED RESPONSE
        DATES IN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SECTION BELOW*******\r\n\r\nThis programme
        aims to innovate around the use of smart metering to design, test, manufacture
        and trial EV chargepoint devices that can perform smart charging in a context
        beyond the existing smart meter roll out scope. The target contexts for these
        devices are on-street charging outside the home, and workplace charging. Other
        contexts will be considered, so long as they are outside the existing smart
        meter roll out scope which comprises home and microbusiness off-street contexts.
        \ \r\nThe programme's aim is to demonstrate that the smart metering system
        provides a holistic and long-term solution for electric vehicle smart charging,
        one which can deliver in a range of charging contexts. \r\n\r\nBackground\r\nThis
        programme contributes to policy objectives set out in the Government's EV
        Smart Charging consultation , which outlines the Government's approach and
        objectives for smart charging of EVs and, seeks evidence on a charging solution.
        \r\nThe long-term EV smart charging solution needs to meet four policy objectives:
        grid protection (including cyber security), consumer protection (including
        interoperability and data privacy), innovation and consumer uptake (of both
        EVs and smart chargepoints). \r\nThe smart meter system was proposed by the
        Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) as the lead option for non-public
        EV smart charging, based on its established ability to deliver load control
        in a way which minimises risks to consumers and the wider electricity system.
        \r\nSmart metering's current scope extends only to domestic and microbusinesses
        however, while a long-term solution for smart charging must deliver in a broader
        range of settings, including public smart charging.  This programme aims to
        show that smart metering can perform smart charging in a range of contexts

        2.0 - call for Delivery Partners\",\"A Youth Programme Like No Other\r\n\r\nThe
        National Citizen Service (NCS) is a personal and social development programme
        for 15-17 year olds. Established in 2011, the programme aims to build a more
        cohesive, mobile and engaged society. By bringing young people together from
        different backgrounds for a unique, shared experience, NCS helps them to fulfil
        their potential and broaden their horizons.\r\n\r\nWe build bridges across
        social divides and ladders to opportunities. We bring young people together
        in common purpose to change their perspectives and lives for good. We push
        them hard to see what they can achieve, smashing the self-doubt that holds
        too many back.\r\n\r\nNCS, whenever it happens, is always built on these foundations;\r\n\r\nSocial
        mixing - young people are provided with the opportunity to mix and build relationships
        with people from different social backgrounds.\r\n\r\nChallenge - NCSers are
        taken out of their comfort zone (physically and emotionally) and supported
        to build strength of character.\r\n\r\nIncreased responsibility and independence
        - young people experience a progressive journey with an increasing sense of
        responsibility.\r\n\r\nReflection - young people are supported to learn from
        experiences in the programme.\r\n\r\nSocial action - NCSers are enabled to
        connect with and impact upon their community, developing skills and knowledge
        useful for future life. Inspiration Young people are encouraged to continue\r\nto
        mix, contribute to their community and achieve personal goals post NCS. NCS
        exists to help tackle some of the biggest social challenges in our country.\r\n\r\nWhy
        NCS is here\r\n\r\nSocial cohesion - to bring our community together by building
        stronger, more integrated communities and fostering young people from different
        backgrounds.\r\n\r\nSocial mobility - to build essential skills for life and
        work, investing in our country's future talent.\r\n\r\nSocial engagement -
        to encourage young people in social action in their communities and the democratic
        process, building their understanding of their responsibilities as citizens.\r\n\r\nAbout

        co-funding from NIHR (National Institute for Health Research) we seek equipment
        offering reliable, user-friendly, quantitative, label-free determination of
        molecular interactions between a wide variety of biomolecules.\r\n\r\nWe focus
        on the problems of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from fundamental science
        to translation into clinical benefit. We bring together scientists and clinicians
        to tackle all aspects of AMR. One aspect of our work relates to understanding
        the molecular mechanisms of AMR. The ability to measure molecular interactions
        in a quantitative manner will enhance our research capabilities. The ability
        to measure the strength of interactions is crucial to mechanistic understanding,
        e.g. between a bacterial protein and an antibiotic.\r\n\r\nOur current equipment
        is a single channel, operator-intensive machine that is suitable for preliminary
        studies on molecules with a molecular weight of > 10,000 Da. This has become
        a bottleneck for our studies due to: 1) its low capacity and 2) its inability
        to detect interactions between small molecules has prompted us to acquire
        extra capabilities and increased throughput.\r\n\r\nThis is an non-EU open

        environments where pupils are respectful of one another and are free from
        the disruption that can damage their education. Schools also need to be safe

        behaviour hubs programme will begin in September 2020 and will run for an

        behaviour cultures and practices to work in partnership with those that want
        to turn around their behaviour culture, sharing good practice, and equipping
        other heads and senior leaders with the tools to improve their approach. Schools
        will cluster to form hubs to learn from each other. \r\n\r\nThe programme
        will be based on Tom Bennett's review of behaviour in schools 'Creating a

        (The Council) is an upper tier local authority in the West Midlands region
        of England. Amongst the statutory obligations the Council has a duty to deliver
        are, those which relate to Adult Social Care, which are primarily outlined
        in the Care Act 2014. The Council fulfils these obligations and other non-statutory
        responsibilities through its People Directorate. The People Directorate is
        responsible for the commissioning of in-house and externally sourced services
        for Adults, including those relating to older people and individuals with
        a learning disability, physical disability or sensory impairment.\r\n      One
        of the Council's obligations under the Care Act 2014 is to provide nursing
        care for older people to eligible individuals.  The Council does not directly
        provide an older people nursing care service, instead, it purchases care for
        individuals on a case by case basis from one of over 50 older people nursing
        homes located in the county. \r\n      \r\n      The Council is looking to
        procure nursing beds in Care Homes across Worcestershire on a \"\"Block-purchased\"\"
        basis.  The term \"\"Block\"\" means the bed will be paid for by the Council
        whether it is used or unoccupied (void). The Council is looking for a minimum
        of five beds per home and aims to contract for this Service with at least
        one home within each of the six Districts within the County of Worcestershire
        in order to maximise local availability for residents and their families.\r\n
        \     \r\n      Beds will become part of the Block on a phased basis.  A bed
        becomes \"\"part of the Block\"\" once first occupied by a Resident referred
        by the Council in accordance with this Specification and continues to be \"\"part
        of the Block\"\" if / when it is subsequently left unoccupied by the Resident.
        \ If / when it becomes vacant, payment will continue to be made on the basis
        of a \"\"Void Payment\"\" by the Council until another Resident is referred
        and admitted to that bed.  No payment for a bed will be made until that bed
        has become part of the Block.  Any bed that becomes vacant within the Block
        will always be used for the next admission.  A bed which is void cannot be
        left unoccupied whilst a new Resident is admitted to an alternative bed under
        this arrangement.   \r\n      \r\n      For further details and to establish

        \       Read: As a consequence of the current coronavirus pandemic, East Suffolk
        Council (ESC) understands that potential operators are likely to be unable
        to devote the time and resource to their tender submission. Therefore ESC,
        in the interest of fairness and transparency, has decided to review the timetable
        for this procurement and effective today pause the procurement process for
        two months. At the end of these two months, on Monday 8 June 2020 further
        information will be given to all prospective tenderers once there is more
        clarity about the effects of the coronavirus situation. There are three potential
        options for the procurement which will be considered by ESC with advice from
        their legal team and in line with the government guidance at the end of the
        two months pause period. The three options are as follows:\r\n        1) a
        revised procurement timetable will be issued with additional time built in
        to reflect the fact that prospective tenderers will need to re-engage with
        the process; or\r\n        2) a further pause period will be introduced and
        communicated to all prospective tenderers; or\r\n        3) the procurement
        will be cancelled and will start from fresh at a later date when it is safe
        and prudent to do so.\r\n        \r\n        Any clarifications already received
        but not yet answered, or received during the paused period will be answered
        if and when the procurement restarts.\r\n        \r\n        ESC hopes that
        you consider this way forward to be the most sensible option for the procurement
        at this time, and apologises for any inconvenience caused by this change to
        the timetable.\r\n        \r\n        Thank you.\r\n        Other additional
        information: The contracting authority considers that this contract may be

        SBS PR18152 Offshore Scientific Drilling and Coring and Ice Management and
        Fleet Provision\",\"The final date and time for the submission of bids is
        Wednesday 20th May 2020 at 14:00 DO NOT apply directly to the buyer. All tender
        information MUST be submitted through the Delta eSourcing Portal. Please follow
        the URL contained in the 'Other Information' section.\r\n\r\nThe estimated
        budget for the entire requirement across both lots is $10,000,000 USD to $19,400,000
        USD. This budget is inclusive of the offshore scientific drilling and coring,
        the ice management and fleet provision, and the drilling platform as well
        as fuel which is anticipated to be a large proportion of the budget.\r\n\r\nIn
        2021 International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) will undertake a drilling/coring
        expedition to the high Arctic, using a drillship. Drilling will only be possible
        if there is a robust, integrated method to manage the ice conditions.\r\n\r\nThis
        procurement is divided in to two lots:\r\n\r\nLot 1: This Lot is for a scientific
        drilling and coring capability to operate in the high Arctic during the annual
        minimum\r\nice cover period and  includes the provision of the drilling platform.\r\nThe
        minimum objectives are to continuously core two boreholes. The 1st borehole
        to 900m below the seabed (WD 815m) and the 2nd borehole to 50m below the seabed,
        (WD 875m). This will require the drillship to continuously stay on station
        until the completion of each borehole.\r\nThe operational dates are linked
        to the minimum ice coverage, i.e. a period of up to 34 days on site between
        mid-August and end of September. In addition, there is passage to and from
        the work area.\r\n\r\nLot 2: This Lot is for an integrated ice and fleet management
        to support a scientific drilling/coring expedition to the Arctic Ocean, under
        the auspices of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). \r\nThe
        ice and fleet management can be broken into three components that must co-ordinate
        and work closely together. These three components are: \r\n1. Ice and weather
        forecasting \r\n2. Icebreaker fleet management\r\n3. Icebreaker vessels (maximum
        of 3)\r\n\r\nThe integrated ice and fleet management package must allow the
        drillship to stay on station and must cover all three components. The requirement
        covers provision of the following responsibilities:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tProvide
        an ice and fleet management service, 24 hour/day for the duration of the expedition.\r\n\u2022\tIce
        management plan.\r\n\u2022\tOperating procedures.\r\n\u2022\tHSE assessment
        and procedures.\r\n\u2022\tUnderstand the needs of a drilling campaign and
        the limitations of a drilling platform and drilling operation.\r\n\u2022\tAll
        equipment and software required.\r\n\u2022\tAll data required.\r\n\u2022\tAll
        Icebreaker capability (except 'Oden' if available)\r\n\u2022\tAll personnel
        required.\r\n\u2022\tAll ancillary services.\r\n\u2022\tBe an adviser to the
        Customer on all ice management related matters.\r\n\u2022\tUse the icebreakers,
        if required, to assist the drilling platform to transit to and from the work
        area.\r\n\u2022\tAttend project meetings and actively participate in the planning
        and execution of this expedition.\r\nMaintain excellent relationship with
        the drilling company when known.\r\n\r\n\",,,\"Any region\",\"34500000 43131200

        will be expected to deliver services from various locations in the borough
        as well as from outside the borough as may be required. \r\n\r\nThe definition
        of supervised contact in context of this service, is contact arranged for
        children who are the subject of care proceedings (as defined by section 31
        of the Children Act 1989), where proceedings have ended, and the child remain
        in the care of the Local Authority. For all these children, the risks and
        concern regarding the significant adults in their immediate and extended family
        are such that supervised contact needs to be fully supervised, monitored and
        recorded.\r\n\r\nThe service will have a clear focus on providing a high-quality
        service and promoting positive experiences and outcome for children, young
        people and their families. \r\n\r\nEaling Council has a duty to promote contact
        between children who are being looked after and their families of origin,
        in accordance with the requirements of the Children Act 1989 and associated
        Regulations and Guidance. Ealing Council currently provides some of its statutory
        obligations through the In-house service. The successful provider will work
        alongside the Council's own in-house contact supervision service to enable
        the Council to meet its obligations.\r\n\r\nThe maximum budget available for
        the delivery of this service is approximately \xA395,000.00 per annum and
        is likely to remain fixed for the lifetime of the contract subject to service
        needs. The duration of the contract is likely to be for 2 years plus 2 potential

        Those providers approved to join the system can then be invited by local commissioners
        to bid to provide APMS services when local needs arise.\r\n\r\nThe PDPS is
        a 4-year procurement exercise managed through a new e-procurement\r\nplatform
        and will see:\r\n\r\n- GP providers appointed to an electronically managed
        list of approved providers\r\n- GP providers can apply and be added to this
        list at any time during the 4-year period, unlike a traditional procurement
        framework,\r\n- once approved onto the PDPS, GP providers can be invited via
        the e-platform to respond to requests for APMS services from local commissioners.
        These local 'call-offs' will be matched to the bespoke needs of local commissioners.\r\n\r\nTo
        ensure the PDPS can be managed efficiently while also being sensitive to local
        commissioner (and provider) needs it will be broken down in to Lots\r\n\r\nLot
        1 - Substantive APMS Contracts\r\nLot 2 - GP Caretaker Contracts\r\n\r\nThe
        PDPS will be further broken down into geographical sub-Lots (7 sub-Lots in
        line with the 7 NHSEI regional areas). GP Providers can apply to be an approved
        APMS and/or caretaker provider in one or more of the stated Lots and Sub-Lots.
        Application on to the approved provider list does not commit providers to
        providing APMS services, nor does it guarantee a provider will be awarded
        a contract through the PDPS, but it does mean providers will be able to bid
        when local needs arise. Applications to join the PDPS will be managed in consecutive
        \"\"Rounds\"\". These Rounds have specific start and end dates by which applications
        must be submitted. If a provider misses the deadline to submit an application
        for a particular Round, they can submit their application for evaluation as
        part of the next Round.\r\n\r\nThe deadline for applications for the first
        Round is 12.00 (noon) on 14.02.20. The second Round will run from 14.02.20
        to 13.03.20. Further Rounds are scheduled to follow.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated
        that the system will be in place ready to undertake Call-Off procurements
        by April 2020.\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease refer to the online document set available

        effective assessment & short-term interventions (i.e. fewer than 8-12 weeks)
        that will enable them avoid hospital admission to remain in the community
        and live well. There may be exceptions to the length of stay given individual

        and support packages who will bid for referrals put out by the Commissioning
        and Placements Team. \r\n\r\nThe service is required to ensure that the local
        authority fulfils its duty towards Looked after Children and Children who
        are homeless by providing sufficient local accommodation and prevent the use
        of Bed and Breakfast provisions for 16 - 18 year olds. There is a statutory
        duty to provide this provision.  \r\n\r\nIf we do not have appropriate safe
        accommodation for our young people we will not be meeting the duty as a corporate
        parent and risk vulnerable young people being at risk of exploitation.\r\n\r\nThis
        is a re-tender of an existing framework, however we now intend to procure

        are to be carried out wherever possible.  Replacements and replacement parts
        are to be dispatched with a maximum of one working day.\r\n \r\nWe currently

        \ Handsets should be lightweight with a slim profile and be provided or compatible
        with earpieces.   \r\nIt is desirable that the provider will deliver training
        to end users on handset use and to dispatchers on use of the system, including
        refresher training on at least an annual basis.  User guidance notes are essential.
        \ We are looking for a shared revenue service where the provider will carry

        of suitable education otherwise than at school for children of compulsory
        school age who, by reason of exclusion from school or otherwise, will not
        receive a suitable education without these arrangements.\r\n\r\nDerby City
        Council, on behalf of Kingsmead School, now  wishes to invite applications
        for inclusion on a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) for these services. By
        creating a DPS we will give Kingsmead School the flexibility of allowing new
        organisations to join at any time over the course of the DPS, subject to them
        meeting the initial suitability criteria which  will be set out in the DPS.\r\n\r\nAll
        service requirements over the course of the DPS will then be tendered by way
        of mini-competition, allowing all  organisations on the DPS at that time the
        opportunity to bid for the requirements at what would be a market appropriate
        rate at that time.  \r\n\r\nOther Free Schools, Academies and Independent
        Schools within the city of Derby may also access the DPS with the support
        of Kingsmead School. \r\n\r\nThe DPS will operate initially from 01/06/2018
        to 31/05/2021, with the option of up to four further annual extensions. \r\n\r\nThis

        on a similar two monthly basis. \r\n\r\nAn EU Light Touch procurement tender
        exercise which is compliant with the Public Contract Regulations 2015 will
        be undertaken to select providers for the DPS which will offer access to pre-approved

        as defined under the Public Contract Regulations 2015, Regulation 34, but
        is a modified version. This is because Section 7 - Education and Training
        services (the Light Touch Regime as allowed under Regulations 74 to 77) are

        an open list: applicants can apply to join during its term if the applicant
        satisfies the selection requirements. The APL will be open for new applications
        from the date of publication of the invitation to participate documents and
        will remain open for new applications at any time during the APLs term. Following
        an evaluation process applicants will receive an outcome notification. Service
        users will predominantly be people with learning disabilities/autism, people
        with mental health needs, people with physical disabilities. But will also
        include a number of any other service user category. As determined appropriate

        and/or autism and who display behaviours that can be described as challenging.\r\nSuccessful
        applicants will be required to sign an APL Agreement and will be appointed
        as a provider. The APL will be used by the Council and associates to call-off
        when care and support is required in a supported housing setting. The call-off
        procedure provides flexibility in the way the Council will formulate and award
        service contracts with the intention of providing the best possible care and
        support to people and will be based upon the core service specification and
        core service contract. Existing business is anticipated to be retained by
        existing providers who have been successful in applying to the APL, on the
        basis of Service user choice. It is also anticipated that new business will
        arise each year. Successful providers may be required to produce an annual
        service development plan for each service contract to respond to changing
        needs and have regard to service efficiency and improvement. Social value

        Make Happen Quasi-DPS\",\"Make Happen is a collaborative project which is
        funded and monitored by Office for Students (OfS), with the funding held at
        the University of Essex, as the lead institution.  Make Happen is the working
        name of the current National Collaborative Outreach Programme partnership
        for Essex, although it is also known as the Essex Collaborative Outreach Network
        (ECON).  \r\n      Currently, Make Happen uses a model where schools and those
        including sixth forms work collaboratively with their Collaborative Outreach
        Officer to design a programme of activity which suits their needs and encourages
        students to progress to higher education.  Further Education (FE) Institutions
        follow a Make Happen led programme, where students are exposed to a variety
        of workshops linked to their future successes, including CV and Personal Statement
        Writing, applications to HE and what to expect on an open day. \r\n      As
        it stands, the National Collaborative Outreach Programme (NCOP) brings together
        29 partnerships of universities, colleges and other local partners to deliver
        outreach programmes to young people in years 9 to 13. Their work is focused
        on local areas where higher education participation is lower than might be
        expected given the GCSE results of the young people who live there.\r\n      The
        current programme started in January 2017 and aims to:\r\n      \u2022\treduce
        the gap in higher education participation between the most and least represented
        groups\r\n      \u2022\tsupport young people to make well-informed decisions
        about their future education\r\n      \u2022\tsupport effective and impactful
        local collaboration by higher education providers working together with schools,
        colleges, employers and other partners\r\n      \u2022\tcontribute to a stronger
        evidence base around 'what works' in higher education outreach and strengthen
        evaluation practice in the sector.\r\n      We are looking to find suppliers
        to deliver schools and/or FEI activity which support the goals above. The
        activity could focus on whole year groups, focused group activity or one to
        one activity.\r\n      \r\n      The duration of the Quasi-DPS will be for
        initial period of 20 months, with the option to extend for a further 3 x 12months
        (in 12 months increments), subject to confirmation of funding by the Office
        for Students.\r\n      \r\n      If you are interested please register on

        Purchasing System for the Provision of Work Focused Activities\",\"The description
        below remains unchanged, however for details relating to the current COVID
        19 situation please see the additional text section.\r\nThe Department for
        Work and Pensions (DWP) intends to establish a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS)
        to procure Work Focused Activities in the Jobcentre Plus Districts in England,
        Scotland and Wales. The DPS is for the procurement of social and other services
        referred to in Regulation 74 of the Public Contracts Regulations (2015) and
        as such, the intention is to use a light touch regime, rather than the full
        regime described in Regulation 34 (Dynamic Purchasing System). \r\n\r\nThis
        national DPS is intended to replace the current DPS for Work Focused Activities
        in DWP Central England Group, also known as the Proof of Concept (PoC). Operating
        a DPS offers a number of commercial and operational advantages for both the
        buyer and for the potential Suppliers, compared to traditional contracting
        methods.  The DPS will be a more effective and responsive tool, with the potential
        to create administrative savings and allow the buyer to respond to individual
        requirements more swiftly.  It will simplify and reduce the time and cost
        involved for those Suppliers on the DPS in bringing their services to market,
        for example by reducing the duplication of effort created by participation
        in multiple, separate procurement competitions.  Consequently it is anticipated
        that the DPS will, over time, be extended to procure other categories of service
        spend.\r\nThis National DPS is for the sole use of the DWP.\r\nThe anticipated
        period of the DPS will run from the date of signing of the earliest DPS Agreement
        (likely to be 25 July 2016), for four years.  \r\n \r\nEstimated funding for
        Work Focused Activities for 2016-2017, excluding VAT, will be up to \xA335m.
        Thereafter funding for DPS procurement will be annually agreed (amounts to
        be confirmed), and may include monies from other funding streams.\r\n\r\nThe
        Invitation to Tender Pack is available on Bravosolution. Your tender response
        should be submitted via BravoSolution. If you are not a BravoSolution registered

        to adults with complex needs within their own accommodation - to be known
        hereon in as 'Supported Living'. \r\nThe term 'Supported Living' for the purposes
        of this Service refers to the provision of support that is delivered within
        a person's tenanted housing or their own home where appropriate. The provision
        of care, support or supervision received by a Customer (or tenant), is not
        linked to or integrated with their accommodation.\r\n\r\nLot 2 - Supported
        Housing\r\nDerby City Council requires integrated Support and Accommodation
        for adults with eligible needs - hereon in to be called 'Supported Housing'.\r\nThe
        term 'Supported Housing' for the purposes of this Service refers to an integrated
        package of housing and support delivery. Care, support or supervision received
        by a Customer (or tenant), is linked to their Accommodation. The Customer
        would not be living in the dwelling if they did not require the associated
        care, support or supervision. \r\nThe Council's intention is to work with
        Registered Service Providers only (Registered with the Regulator of Social
        Housing) who can source and supply Accommodation and deliver integrated housing
        and /or care and support that meets Customers' needs. \r\nProviders are required
        to be registered with The Regulator of Social Housing.\r\n\r\nLot 3 - Accommodation
        Only\r\nDerby City Council aims to ensure there is a sufficient supply of
        suitable Accommodation for people in Derby with eligible Support needs and
        therefore wishes to develop a closer relationship with landlords/ Service
        Providers of Accommodation Only. \r\nThe Council will not contract directly
        with Service Providers for this Service. Instead, customers will contract
        directly with Service Providers through tenancy agreements.\",,,\"East Midlands\",\"85000000

        to the current and future health of the population in Northamptonshire. People
        are considered obese when their BMI (a measurement obtained by dividing a
        person's weight in kilograms by the square of the person's height in metres)
        exceeds 30 kg/m2. The service is for 16+ year olds. \r\n\r\n\r\nOrganisations
        wishing to Tender need to demonstrate that they have a strong understanding
        of what a Tier 2 Adult Weight Management service requires. Organisations must
        have the capacities, resources and expertise to deliver this service at any
        locality within Northamptonshire, taking into account the demographics and
        the health inequalities within Northamptonshire. \r\n\r\n\r\nThese weight
        management services are being procured under a multiple-provider Dynamic Purchasing
        System. There will be no limit to the number of Providers accepted onto the
        Dynamic Purchasing System, providing they meet the selection and award criteria
        (as set out in the Tender documentation). This DPS Agreement is for four years,
        commencing 1st October 2016. The Authority will use the tender process of
        the Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) to enable Providers to join the DPS at
        anytime. The DPS will be available until 30th September 2020, and TUPE does
        not apply. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe detailed requirements are defined in the Tender
        documents, please visit the LGSS Procurement Portal - www.lgssprocurementportal.co.uk
        to formally register your interest in this opportunity and to access the tender
        documentation. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe deadline for completed Indicative Tenders to
